## Description

> Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

 
> The goal of Fashion MNIST is to serve as a drop-in replacement for the traditional MNIST dataset, which is sometimes referred to as the "Hello, World" of computer vision machine learning applications. The format of the clothing you'll use here is the same as that of the handwritten digits (0, 1, 2, etc.) in the MNIST dataset.

> 60,000 images were used to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images. You can access the Fashion MNIST directly from TensorFlow. Import and load the Fashion MNIST data directly from TensorFlow
